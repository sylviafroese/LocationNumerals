# LocationNumerals
Create a class to convert from decimal numbers to location numerals and back. This class should have 3 methods:
1) A Method that takes an integer and returns the location numeral in abbreviated form. 
   That is, you pass in 9 and it returns “ad"
     
2) A Method that takes a location numeral and returns its value as an integer. That is, you pass “ad” in, and it returns 9
        
3) A Method that takes a location numeral and returns it in abbreviated form. That is, you pass in “abbc” and it returns “ad"

These methods should handle integers up to 2^25 (33,554,432).
